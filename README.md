**Continuous-Time Fixed-Lag Smoothing for LiDAR-Inertial-Camera SLAM**

CLIC is a tightly-coupled multi-modal SLAM algorithms based on continuous-time fixed-lag smoothing, it supports a variety of sensor combinations, like the LiDAR-inertial and LiDAR-inertial-camera SLAM systems, and online timeoffset calibration is also naturally supported. More importantly, benefiting from the marginalization and the derived analytical Jacobians for optimization, the proposed continuous-time SLAM systems can achieve real-time performance regardless of the high complexity of continuous-time formulation.

ðŸŽˆ **[News]**  We release [Coco-LIC](https://github.com/APRIL-ZJU/Coco-LIC), which adopts non-uniform B-splines to tightly fuse LIC data.

### Prerequisites

- [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation) (tested with Melodic)

- Eigen3

- Ceres 1.14

- OpenCV 3.3

- yaml-cpp

  ```shell
  sudo apt-get install libyaml-cpp-dev
  ```

- [livox_ros_driver](https://github.com/Livox-SDK/livox_ros_driver.git)
- ~~Sophus~~ has been included in `src/sophus_lib`

### Install

```shell
mkdir -p ~/catkin_clic/src
cd ~/catkin_clic/src
git clone https://github.com/APRIL-ZJU/clic.git
git clone https://github.com/Livox-SDK/livox_ros_driver.git
cd ~/catkin_clic
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```

### Example

- Download [ntu_viral_dataset](https://ntu-aris.github.io/ntu_viral_dataset/) or [newer_college_dataset](https://ori-drs.github.io/newer-college-dataset/stereo-cam/) or [LVI dataset](https://github.com/TixiaoShan/LVI-SAM#datasets) or [livox dataset](https://github.com/ziv-lin/r3live_dataset).

- Configure parameters in the `config/ct_odometry_***.yaml` file.

  - `config_path`: the path of `config` folder 
  - `bag_path`: the file path of rosbag  

- Run on ntu viral dataset for example.

  ```shell
  roslaunch clic odometry.launch config_path:=config/ct_odometry_ntu.yaml
  ```

  The estimated trajectory is saved in the folder`./src/clic/data`.
